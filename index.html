    Peekskill was established as a distinct locale by travelers from the Hudson River in the 1600s.
    The English sea captain and explorer, Henry Hudson sailed up and down the river in the autumn of 1609 onboard
    the Dutch ship Half Moon. This voyage of exploration began the land claims made by the countries of Holland and England to the river valley.
